# **M13E: Overcoming Triskaidekaphobia**

Welcome to **M13E**, a compact yet thrilling game crafted for the js13kGames 2024 competition! This year's theme, **Triskaidekaphobia** (the fear of the number 13), inspired me to create a maze game with a unique twist.

## **Game Overview**

Each level gives you **13 seconds** to:
- **Find the exit** before time runs out.
- **Collect coins** scattered throughout the maze.
- **Avoid dangerous traps** like lava and obstacles.
- **Utilize portals** to walk through walls as the difficulty ramps up.

The further you go, the more coins and obstacles you’ll face, but you’ll always be racing against that 13-second timer.

**Key Features:**
- **Time Pressure:** 13 seconds per level—beat the clock or lose the game.
- **Maze Exploration:** Navigate dynamic mazes filled with hazards and surprises.
- **Coin Collection:** Grab the coins to unlock the exit and advance to the next challenge.
- **Portal Mechanics:** Unlock portals to phase through walls and solve tricky puzzles.
- **Minimal Size, Maximum Fun:** Built for the js13kGames competition, the entire game is under 13 KB!

## **How to Play**

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `dist/index.html` in your web browser to start the game.
3. Navigate through the maze, collect coins, and dodge obstacles within the time limit!
